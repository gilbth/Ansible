Ansible has a variety of package management modules for any flavor of Linux, but thereâ€™s also a generic package module that can be used
for easier cross-platform Ansible usage.

If you want to install a generic package like `git` on any Debian, RHEL, Fedora, Ubuntu, CentOS, FreeBSD, etc. system, you can use the 
command:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

$ ansible app -b -m package -a "name=git state=present"

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

"package" works much the same as yum, apt, and other package management modules.
