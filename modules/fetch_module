# Fetch works in a very similar way as the copy module
# but in reverse, the files will be copied from remote

# Grab the sshd_config file from all our servers in the inventory and paste it into /tmp, by default puts the file from each folder 
# into a folder in the destination with the name of the host, in this case the IP addresses.

$ ansible all -b -m fetch -a "src=/etc/ssh/sshd_config dest=/tmp"


# e.g.
# /tmp/192.168.56.114/etc/ssh/sshd_config 
# /tmp/192.168.56.105/etc/ssh/sshd_config
